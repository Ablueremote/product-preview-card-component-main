## My process 
 - I started with a flexbox to get my initial layout. 
 - Added colors to my container and background.
 - Imported both images (product + cart icon) & 2 font types from google fonts.
 - added image to my flexbox
 - added text to my 2 element in flexbox
 - styled my text elements, padding & spacing
 - created cart button w/ cart icon
 -  started mobile design (maxwidth response) + changed flexbox to column
 - adjusted element sizing in new flexbox

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Flexbox was easier to manipulate in this project.
- How to import multiple fonts
- Manipulate images for different sizes/ mobile layout
- style different elements with different colors for added flair

<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
<p class="price-1">$149.99 <span class="price-2">$169.99 </span> </p>
```
@media only screen and (min-width: 320px) and (max-width: 576px) {
    body {
        margin: 1rem;
        padding-top: 0;
    }
```

### Continued development

- Using flexbox and getting more comfortable manipulating elements
- sizing elements and placing them where I want
- creating and adding unique styles to my web pages
